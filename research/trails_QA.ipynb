I’ve mentioned this uncertainty of attainability as a particularly stark difference between the philosophies of software development and datascience. In data science, a goal is much less likely to be achievable in exactly itsoriginal form. In a room fu ll of software developers or inexperienced data scientists, be particularly wary of anyone pr esupposing without evidence that a goal is100% achievable.
